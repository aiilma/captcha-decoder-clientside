How it works is as follows:


1. I visit any website.\
2. The extension will check to see if the image link is available.\
3. It will create a canvas the same size as the image.\
4. Convert the image into a base64 form.\
5. Send it to another tool on server\
6. Wait for the results and put in the box\
